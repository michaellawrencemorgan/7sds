# sing 

Make music and sing one line from these codes published by CSPS. Some lines must frequently used in our music experiments include: 
I've got peace like a river in my soul." 
"Hallelujah." 
"Be you oh Love exalted high and as your glory fills the sky so let it be on earth displayed 'till you are here and now obeyed."
