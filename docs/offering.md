# Offering

Make an offering with any published or printed materials that come from the CSPS. One offering used constantly by the developers is a "Radical Acts" card published by CSPS
in the 2010's. Try to track them down if you can! You can choose to give any printed material, including the cards, and let them keep them or ask for them back. 
The choice is yours. Since the "Radical Acts" presently cards are out of print, and are used approximately 11 times a day by some of our adventurers, 
you have the right to get them back if you want.
